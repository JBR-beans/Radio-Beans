# Radio-Beans
A media player that loads music files and displays a visualizer.

This project utilizes WinForms (.NET, C#) and some LibVLC packages to play media. The focus is to be able to make visualizers that are driven by the audio data fed into it. In order to achieve this it is necessary to maintain some core features such as reliably reading from and processing a file, supporting multiple file types, and supporting standard media player functionality such as play/pause/seek/stop/etc., and switching between currently playing audio/video tracks.
